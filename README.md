# 6-DOF-Robotic-Arm-with-Sensor-Architecture-Cloud-Ready-Predictive-Maintenance-Pipeline

# Abstract

This project focuses on the design and implementation of a 6-Degree-of-Freedom (6-DOF) robotic arm integrated with a multi-sensor architecture to enable a cloud-ready predictive maintenance pipeline. The system is designed to monitor mechanical and electrical health parameters such as vibration, temperature, and current consumption, enabling early fault detection using machine learning techniques.

The project emphasizes embedded systems engineering, robotics, system architecture design, and ML pipeline planning, reflecting real-world industrial predictive maintenance challenges.

# Problem Statement

Industrial robotic systems experience:

Unexpected joint failures

Motor overheating and overload

Bearing wear and misalignment

Increased downtime and maintenance costs

Conventional maintenance approaches are reactive or schedule-based. This project explores a predictive maintenance approach, where sensor data is continuously analyzed to anticipate failures before they occur.

# Project Objectives

Design a 6-DOF robotic arm suitable for sensor instrumentation

Implement a distributed sensor architecture at critical joints

Collect and process real-time sensor data

Design a cloud-ready ML pipeline for predictive maintenance

Maintain modular separation between hardware, firmware, and analytics layers

Prepare the system for future edge and cloud inference
